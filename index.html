            <h3>Work & studies</h3>
            <p>I have been working as an E-commerce Coordinator at Blåkläder for the past seven years.
            <br>I have a degree as an E-business Manager, and I have also continued studying during my time at Blåkläder in topics such as
            <br>- Interaction design
            <br>- Growth hacking
            <br>- Digital analytics
            <br><br>
            <p>Blåkläder is one of the leading manufacturers of workwear and I have experience from developing the E-commerce business 
                within both B2B and B2C. My role has always been very varied and I have learned a lot.
            <br>User experience and data-driven decisions are some things I am extra passionate
            about. I coordinate internally and externally to constantly improve our digital
            business and drive growth. 
            <br>This includes collaboration with our developers that are
            located in both Sweden and Sri Lanka, as well as working closely with internal
            departments and stakeholders at Blåkläder.
            <br>
            <br>I would like to improve my technical skills, to become more flexible in my work positions and to be more creative and 
            self-going. So here I am, taking this course in frontend development. <br></p>
